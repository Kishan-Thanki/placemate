# Contributing to Placemate

Welcome to the Placemate project! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get started with the project and understand our workflow.

## ü§ù Our Code of Conduct
We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please be respectful and professional in all of your interactions.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To begin contributing, please follow this standard workflow. It helps us keep the project organized and ensures everyone's work is integrated smoothly.

### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kishan-Thanki/placemate.git
cd placemate
```

### Checkout the `dev` Branch
All new work should be based on the latest version of the `dev` branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

### Create a New Feature Branch
Create a new branch for your specific task or feature. Please use the following naming convention to keep things consistent:

```
your-username/feature-name
```

For example:

```bash
git checkout -b alice/user-authentication
git checkout -b bob/homepage-design
```

This ensures we know who is working on what.

### Make Your Changes and Commit
Write your code and make your commits with clear, descriptive messages.

### Push Your Branch
Push your new branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin your-username/feature-name
```

## üìù Pull Request (PR) Workflow
When you're ready to submit your changes, follow these steps to create a pull request:

1. **Open a Pull Request:** On GitHub, open a pull request from your feature branch to the `dev` branch.
2. **Describe Your Changes:** In the PR description, clearly explain the purpose of your changes. Link to any relevant issues.
3. **Request a Review:** Ask at least one other team member to review your pull request. They will check for bugs, code quality, and consistency.
4. **Merge:** Once your PR has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the `dev` branch.

**Note:** No one should ever push directly to the `main` or `dev` branches.

## üêõ Issues and Task Tracking
We use GitHub's Issues to track bugs and tasks.

- **Reporting a Bug:** If you find a bug, please check the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If not, open a new issue and provide a clear, detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.
- **Requesting a Feature:** If you have an idea for a new feature, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.
- **Claiming a Task:** If you want to work on a task, assign yourself to an open issue to let others know you are working on it.

## üíª Tech Stack
This project's front-end will be built using a modern framework. We will be using either **React** for a website or **Flutter** for a web and mobile application. The back-end will be built with **Django**.
